true for every wagon and the big hatchback on these tends to promote it too Good washing gives you a good clean base for sealant to adhere then good sealant provides a good base for wax Good sealant and wax will give you the best chance of removing dust with no effort Good washing high quality products CAN BE worth their price loads of others arent so do your research Use a soap that wont immediately strip wax and or sealant unless youre stripping it down to put on a new coat of both then dish soap can be very effective but dont use that all the time as it can dry stuff out Look into claying the paint too if you dont havent already Touchfree dry with compressed air or electric not gas leaf blower This all takes less time than youd think Then wax and sealant which always takes more time than youd think Do sealant first let it cure then wax Otherwise just do sealant but know that adding wax will extend the life of the sealant I dont know much about ceramic coatings maybe theyre worth it Otherwise spend appropriately on sealant As far as wax liquid waxes can sometimes have solvents that make them flow but that will also strip sealant so be mindful of that If youve got a good solid sealant wax combo washing with just foam and water can be enough to restore the look using a mild car soap 3 steps water big fat water not just a spritz you want to carry off the big stuff then a thick layer of foamy soap In the shade is best let it sit until it starts to run but not long enough to dry then rinse Repeat if necessary Even better if you have a way to add some pressure then follow the foam soak with pressure soap and rinse ie not like a 3500 psi pressure washer but something car appropriate there are a lot of good electric pressure washers that will do the job Dry with compressed air   blower this will be super easy on account of the good layer of wax On my model s I can finish that whole routine in about 15 minutes and it looks good as new I try to avoid using the

getting out last and will adjust to that You can manually adjust temp when it’s preconditioning if you want it to heat or cool depending the situation  2 It’s not necessary but if it’s plugged in it will cool your car off of land power so when you get in the car doesn’t have to use it’s main battery to try to cool the inside to 70 from say 110 degrees on its own it will have an easier time maintaining your preferred temp and use less battery for that trip once you unplug  3 Only when it’s freezing outside and you want your car to defrost or if it’s scorching hot out and you don’t want to sweat or want a cool feeling as soon as you get to your car say it was parked in a Disneyland parking lot all day and you have a long walk in the sun to get to it I would start cooling from the app before I got to it I guess for extreme weather conditions it makes more sense Also keep in mind preconditioning is location based so if you park the car at the same spot at various locations you can program it to precondition or not at a certain time based on your habits But be careful if you’re not plugged in it will still precondition I charge at work 3 out of 5 days a week and tell it to precondition by 7pm because I usually just keep my plug connected but on days I’ve left it unplugged it will cool or heat my car as early as 645pm when I don’t really want it to use battery I’ll turn off climate when I notice this manually for the day It’s up to you  Also keep in mind precondition warms your battery to its optimal temp if enough time is allowed So if it’s freezing outside and you precondition and you drive off your battery will allow full regen right away below 80 SoC instead of having to warm up on itself before regen kicks in 100 and on hot days I dunno it warms or cools the battery to ideal temp for efficiency I believe Does it really help probably but I can’t tell :  [(0, 0.05118112), (1, 0.53055084), (2, 0.38327014), (3, 0.034997925)]\n","1\n","It begins conditioning

a species To this end I hold M&M duels Taking two candies between my thumb and forefinger I apply pressure squeezing them together until one of them cracks and splinters That is the “loser” and I eat the inferior one immediately The winner gets to go another round I have found that in general the brown and red M&Ms are tougher and the newer blue ones are genetically inferior I have hypothesized that the blue M&Ms as a race cannot survive long in the intense theater of competition that is the modern candy and snackfood world Occasionally I will get a mutation a candy that is misshapen or pointier or flatter than the rest Almost invariably this proves to be a weakness but on very rare occasions it gives the candy extra strength In this way the species continues to adapt to its environment When I reach the end of the pack I am left with one M&M the strongest of the herd Since it would make no sense to eat this one as well I pack it neatly in an envelope and send it to M&M

later another message read that the car was ready for pick up We arrive following morning and are advised that was an error on their part and car is still waiting on the struts still a week out and

degradation pretty soon after getting the car So Ive been traveling in a Model Y for about a year and a half using exclusively public lv2 chargers and superchargers Ive been in that position many times where Im going on a drive thats at the limits of the cars range Its totally doable and once you get the hang of hypermiling your anxiety goes down a bit but it is not a fun way to drive Especially on 70+mph roads its sometimes dangerous unless you can find a nice slow big rig to trail Idk if it was like a once a week commute id say the joys of the Tesla would outweigh the extra supercharger trip or cutting it close but if it was a daily thing I would just say either wait for more chargers particularly at work more superchargers right on your route wait for a bigger battery Model S would probably have enough battery for this at twice the price or more realistically just get an ICE or hybrid :  [(0, 0.11183316), (1, 0.6717762), (2, 0.12435917), (3,
